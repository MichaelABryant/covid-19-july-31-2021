# Project 1: COVID-19 EDA (SQL and Tableau)

This repository is for the analysis done on the Our World in Data: COVID-19 dataset. Below you will find an overview of the data, code, and results. The goal of this project was to create two dashboards summarizing the status of COVID-19 using Tableau (where one dashboard is for the world and the other is for the US).

## Coronavirus Dataset

The dataset was gathered from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) and, at the time of collection, spanned from February 24, 2020 to July 31, 2021. The dataset contains 59 variables which are contained within six Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. There was a spreadsheet for each of the following: cases, deaths, testing, hospitalizations and ICU patients, vaccinations, and country demographics.
